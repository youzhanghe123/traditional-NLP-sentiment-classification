# traditional-NLP-sentiment-classification
In this project, I first clean the imdb dataset, and then apply ngram and tf-idf to tokenize the input sentences, and use logistic regression to make prediction, the test accuracy is 0.87.
And I use word mebedding to tokenize the sentences and then feed the tokenized sentences into LSTM, the test accuracy is 0.84.
